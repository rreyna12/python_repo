Personal repo for any python related projects

**Current projects:**
1. **Project_ScrubMigrateContacts_KWCommand-to-AMCards:**
   This project was created as a request from a real estate agent.
   It takes a .csv file exported from Keller William's Command program and re-formats it for all users with data in the birthday or anniversary fields.  This simplifies the upload process to AMCards, then allowing the user to schedule mail for anniversary or birthdays.
   It currently has a very simple, but working, first round implementation of a GUI using python's built in tkinter module.
   Next planned update is to improve the GUI's visuals.
